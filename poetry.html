      <h2>My "I Am From" Poem</h2>
      <pre class="poem-block">
I am from the screen glow of midnight cartoons,  
From Hot Cheetos and Nintendo DS.  
I am from the backyard trampoline,  
Where time felt slower than summer heat.

I am from photos on the fridge and  
"Finish your homework first" on loop.  
I am from laughter, loud debates, and  
the smell of mom’s arroz con pollo.

      <p>
        <strong>Selected Poem:</strong> “Still I Rise” by Maya Angelou
      </p>
      <p>
        This poem resonates deeply with me because of its unshakeable tone of resilience. 
        Each stanza builds like a chant, reaffirming self-worth and strength in the face of oppression...
